you can find my code in colab:

I modify the original Wine and Car Evaluation datasets to make them easier for my code. I add the column names for the two datasets. Also, I use intergers to replace the string of column values in Car evaluation dataset. If you want to rerun my code, please use my modified datasets named "wine.csv" and "car.csv".
